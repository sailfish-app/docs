## Getting Started

Sailfish is built on the DFINITY Internet Computer. To get started developing on this platform, [click here](https://sdk.dfinity.org/).

## Architecture

The core canisters are:

- Token canisters, any tokens that follow the [standard token interface (WIP)](https://github.com/sailfish-app/proposals/blob/master/icip-1.md)
- LiquidityPool, which makes tokens available for trading
- TransactionArchive, which archives transaction data
